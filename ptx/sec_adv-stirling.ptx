  <title>Stirling Numbers of the Second Kind</title>

  <introduction>


    <p>
      Let's take a closer look at the Stirling numbers, first introduced in <xref ref="sec_adv-partitions"/>.  Recall, we use the notation <m>S(k,n)</m> to stand for the number of partitions of a
      <m>k</m> element set with <m>n</m> blocks.  Here is a brief summary of what we have already discovered.
    </p>

    <p>
      Directly from the definition, we see that <m>S(k,1) = 1</m> and <m>S(k,k) = 1</m>.  From these we can compute the remaining Stirling numbers using the recursion
      <me>
        S(k,n) = nS(k-1,n) + S(k-1, n-1).
      </me>
      This recursion is justified by dividing the partitions of <m>[k]</m> into those which contain <m>k</m> as a singleton set (there are <m>S(k-1, n-1)</m> of these) and those that don't (there are <m>n</m> choices for where <m>k</m> could for each of the <m>S(k-1, n)</m> partitions of <m>[k-1]</m> into <m>n</m> blocks).
    </p>

    <p>
      From this, we generated Stirling's second triangle.

    <title>Formulas for Stirling Numbers (of the second kind)</title>

    <p>
      While we might not have a nice closed formula for all Stirling numbers in terms of <m>k</m> and <m>n</m>, we can give closed formulas for those Stirling numbers close to the edges of the triangle.  We have already considered some of these in <xref ref="act_stirlingcomputations"/>.  To get back into the right mindset, start by reproving one of these.
    </p>

    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove <m>S(k, k-1) = \binom{k}{2}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          What are the possible sizes of parts?
        </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>
          If a partition has <m>k-1</m> parts, then one part has two elements, so once we choose those two elements from the <m>k</m> elements, we are done.  Therefore <m>S(k,k-1) = \binom{k}{2}</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </activity>

    <p>
      The proof of the formula above suggests that looking at the sizes of the blocks might be helpful.  Let's see what this might look like with an example.

        <p>
          How many ways are there to partition <m>[5]</m> into three sets?
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            How many partitions of <m>[5]</m> have two blocks of size 1 and one block of size 3?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            There will be <m>10 = \binom{5}{3}</m>.  Once you select the three elements to be in the block of size 3, the other two must be in blocks of size 1 each.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            How many partitions of <m>[5]</m> have one block of size 1 and two of size 2?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Careful here.  The answer is NOT <m>\binom{5}{2}\binom{3}{2}</m>.  Do you see why?
          </p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We can select two elements to be in a block of size 2 in <m>\binom{5}{2}</m> ways.  Then you can select two of the remaining elements for the block of size 2 in <m>\binom{3}{2}</m> ways.  However, just multiplying these two double counts since we do not care about the order in which the blocks appear.  Thus there are <m>\frac{1}{2}\binom{5}{2}\binom{3}{2} = 15</m> partition of <m>[5]</m> of this type.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Are there any other types of partitions we need to consider?  What is <m>S(5,3)</m>?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Any partition of 5 into 3 blocks must have at least one element in each block; the remaining two elements could be in a block together or two different blocks.  So the two cases above are all the cases.  This tell us <m>S(5,3) = 25</m>.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Generalize! Find a formula for <m>S(k, k-2)</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            <m>S(k, k-2) = \binom{k}{3} + \frac{1}{2}\binom{k}{2}\binom{k-2}{2}</m>.  Because we have two fewer blocks than we have elements, there will always either be a block of size three and <m>k-3</m> blocks of size one or two blocks of size two and <m>k-4</m> blocks of size 1.  The first case accounts for <m>\binom{k}{3}</m> partitions (once you have chosen the three elements to be in the large block, you are done).  The second case accounts for <m>\frac{1}{2}\binom{k}{2}\binom{k-2}{2}</m> partitions (pick 2 elements to be together, then 2 of the remaining to be together, but don't care which order you pick these in).
          </p>
        </solution>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            A friend tells you that <m>S(k,k-2) = \binom{k}{3} + 3 \binom{k}{4}</m>.  Prove this is correct also.  If this is the formula you found for the previous part, see the hint.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            If you found this formula for <m>S(k,k-2)</m> in part (e), then pretend your friend claims that <m>S(k, k-2) = \binom{k}{3} + \frac{1}{2}\binom{k}{2}\binom{k-2}{2}</m> and prove why that is correct too.
          </p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The <m>\binom{k}{3}</m> still counts the partitions in which one block has size three.  Now we can pick four elements to be in the two blocks of size 2 in <m>\binom{k}{4}</m> ways.  But these four elements can be broken into two equally sized blocks in 3 ways (pick the cell-mate of the first element).

      Whenever we want to partition <m>k</m> items in <m>n</m> blocks, we can consider cases.  We will represent each type of case with a <term>type vector</term> consisting of a sequence <m>(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k)</m> where each <m>a_i</m> is the number of blocks that have size <m>i</m>.  For example, in partitioning <m>[5]</m> into 3 blocks, the previous activity first asked for the number of partitions with type vector <m>(2,0,1,0,0)</m>, two blocks of size 1 and one of size 3, and then for the number of partitions with type vector <m>(1,2,0,0,0)</m>, one block of size 1 and two of size 2.  Note that <m>\sum_{i=1}^k a_i = n</m> and <m>\sum_{i=1}^k ia_i = k</m>.

            While you might not get this formula by conisdering type vectors, you should be shooting to prove <m>S(k, k-3) = \binom{k}{4} + 10 \binom{k}{5} + 16 \binom{k}{6}</m>

    Recall that the Stirling numbers counted the number of ways to distribute 9 distinct sandwiches to three identical sandwich bags.  This suggests a more realistic question.

        What if the question asked about six sandwiches and two distinct bags? How does having identical bags change the answer?

      <p>
        <m>\binom{9}{3}\binom{6}{3}\binom{3}{3}/3!</m>. First we choose
        three sandwiches for bag 1, then three for bag 2, and put the remainder in

        are in so we have counted each partition <m>3!</m> times.

          Choose three sandwiches for bag one in <m>\binom{9}{3}</m> ways, three for bag two in <m>\binom{6}{3}</m> ways and put the remainder in bag 3.  This gives us <m>\binom{9}{3}\binom{6}{3}=\frac{9!}{3!3!3!}=1680</m> ways.

        <p>
          The <m>\frac{9!}{3!3!3!}</m> suggests another solution. We can line up the

          What do multinomial coefficients have to do with expanding the
          <m>k</m>th power of a multinomial <m>x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n</m>? This result is called
          the <term>multinomial theorem</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          Think about how binomial coefficients relate to expanding a power of a binomial and note that the binomial coefficient <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> and the multinomial coefficient <m>\binom{n}{k,n-k}</m> are the same.
        </p>
      </hint>

      <solution>
        <p>
          When we use the distributive law to multiply out <m>(x_1+x_2+\cdots +x_n)^k</m>, we will get a sum of a bunch of terms of the form <m>x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\cdots x_n^{i_n}</m> where <m>i_1+i_2+\cdots+ i_n=k</m>.  The terms with a given sequence <m>i_1,i_2,\ldots, i_n</m> of exponents will arise from choosing, as we apply the distributive law over and over again, <m>x_1</m> from <m>i_1</m> of the factors, <m>x_2</m> from <m>i_2</m> of the factors, and so on. Thus the number of terms <m>x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\cdots x_n^{i_n}</m> will be the number of ways to label <m>i_1</m> of the factors with a 1, <m>i_2</m> of the factors with a 2, <ellipsis />, and <m>i_n</m> of the factors with an <m>n</m>. The number of ways to do this is a multinomial coefficient, as we now explain. This labeling gives us a function from <m>[k]</m> to <m>[n]</m> as follows. If factor <m>i</m> is labelled <m>j</m> we let <m>f(i) =j</m>. Further each function <m>f</m> from <m>[k]</m> to <m>[n]</m> gives us that maps <m>i_j</m> elements of <m>[k]</m> to <m>j</m> will give us such a labelling. Thus the coefficient of <m>x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\cdots x_n^{i_n}</m> will be the multinomial coefficient <m>\binom{k}{i_1,i_2,\ldots, i_n}</m>.

    <title>Identities with Stirling Numbers</title>


    <p>
      The entries in the Pascal Triangle, <m>\binom{n}{k}</m>, satisfy the nice recursion <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n - 1}{k} + \binom{n - 1}{k - 1}</m> and also have a closed formula: <m>\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}</m>.
      <xref ref="secondstirlingrecurrence"/> gives us a
      recursion for the Stirling numbers <m>S(n,k)</m> and, unfortunately, the best we can do for a <q>closed</q> formula is the following.<fn>This is not really a closed formula since the number of terms in the summation is not fixed.</fn>
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-stirling-closed">

      <hint>
        <p>
          First multiply both sides by <m>n!</m> and then prove that identity.  You might have already done so in <xref ref="act_stirlingpie"/>
        </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            The following argument is due to Polya.
            Suppose you wished to paint n houses and you have <m>k</m> different colors available.
            The first house can be painted in <m>k</m> different ways, the second in <m>k</m> different ways, etc.
            So there are <m>k^{n}</m> ways.
            How many ways actually use all <m>k</m> colors?
            Let <m>\alpha_{i}</m> be the property that no house is painted with the <m>i</m>th color, and let <m>N(\alpha_{i})</m> denote the number of ways of painting the <m>n</m> houses without using the <m>i</m>th color.
            Analogously for <m>N(\alpha_{i},\alpha_{j})</m>, <m>N(\alpha_{i},\alpha_{j},\alpha_{k})</m>, etc.
            Since <m>N(\alpha_{i}) = (k - 1)^{n}</m>, <m>N(a_{i},\alpha_{j}) = ( k - 2)^{n}</m> and so on, the number of ways of painting <m>n</m> houses using all <m>k</m> colors is, using PIE,
            <m>k^{n} -\binom{k}{1} \left(k - 1 \right)^{n} + \binom{k}{2} \left( k - 2 \right)^{n} - \binom{k}{3}      \left( k - 3 \right)^{n} + \ldots + \left( - 1 \right)^{k}\binom{k}{k} 0^{n}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alternately, we could first partition the <m>n</m> houses into <m>k</m> (non-empty) sets, and then paint each set. This can be    accomplished in <m>k!S(n,k)</m> ways. Now equate these two expressions.

      Here is another result identity involving Stirling numbers.

          You have already done this as well, although not with <m>x</m>.
        </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Again, based on the proof by Polya.
            We can paint <m>n</m> houses, with <m>x</m> colors available, in <m>x^{n}</m> ways. Using exactly one color, there are <m>S\left( n,1 \right)x</m> ways. Using exactly two colors there are <m>S\left( n,2 \right)x(x - 1)</m> ways. Continue in this manner.

      It is in this form that James Stirling originally developed these numbers.
      <m>S(k,n)</m> is used to convert from powers to binomial  coefficients as shown in the following:
