  <title>The Principle of Inclusion Exclusion: the Size of a Union</title>

  <introduction>
      <p>
        One of our very first counting
        principles was the <term>sum principle</term><idx><h>sum principle</h></idx> which says that
        the size of a union of disjoint sets is the sum of their sizes.
        Computing the size of overlapping sets requires, quite naturally,
        information about how they overlap. Taking such information into account
        will allow us to develop a powerful extension of the sum principle known
        as the <q>principle of inclusion and exclusion.</q><idx><h>principle of
        inclusion and exclusion</h></idx><idx><h>inclusion and exclusion principle</h></idx>

      <p>
        The difficulty of generalizing <xref ref="threesetintersection">Problem</xref> to
        <xref ref="nsetintersection">Problem</xref> is not likely to be one of being able to
        see what the right conjecture is, but of finding a good notation to
        express your conjecture. In fact, it would be easier for some people to
        express the conjecture in words than to express it in a notation. Here
        is some notation that will make your task easier. Let us define
        <me>
          \bigcap_{i:i\in I}A_i
        </me>
        to mean the intersection over all elements <m>i</m>
        in the set <m>I</m> of
        <m>A_i</m>. Thus
        <men xml:id="intersectionnotation" >
          \bigcap_{i:i\in
          \{1,3,4,6\}} = A_1\cap A_3\cap A_4 \cap A_6.
        </men>
      </p>

      <p>
        This kind of notation, consisting of an operator with a description
        underneath of the values of a dummy variable of interest to us, can be
        extended in many ways. For example
        <mdn>
          <mrow number="no">\sum_{I:I \subseteq \{1,2,3,4\}, \ |I|=2} |\cap_{i\in I}
          A_i|  \amp =  |A_1\cap A_2|+ |A_1\cap A_3|
           +|A_1\cap A_4|</mrow>
          <mrow xml:id="notationsolution"> \amp +  |A_2\cap A_3|+
          |A_2\cap A_4| +|A_3\cap A_4|.</mrow>

            Use notation something like that of <xref ref="intersectionnotation">Equation</xref> and <xref ref="notationsolution">Equation</xref> to express
            the answer to <xref ref="nsetintersection">Problem</xref>. Note there are many
            different correct ways to do this problem. Try to write down more
            than one and choose the nicest one you can. Say why you chose it
            (because your view of what makes a formula nice may be different from
            somebody else's). The nicest formula won't necessarily involve all the
            elements of <xref ref="intersectionnotation">Equations</xref> and <xref ref="notationsolution"></xref>.

            S\not=\emptyset}(-1)^{|S|-1}|\bigcap_{i: i\in S}A_i|
          </me>
            I chose this
            way of writing the formula partly because it is efficient with symbols;
            for example, it uses only one sum sign. But more importantly I chose it
            because it captures what I would want to say in words: ``You sum, over
            all ways of choosing an intersection of the sets <m>A_i</m>, the size of the
            intersection times a sign factor that is -1 if you are intersecting
            an even number of sets and 1 if you are intersecting an odd number."
            If I were writing my solution out in words, I would probably assume
            that nobody would think about the possibility of an intersection of the
            empty set of the
            <m>A_i</m>s, but I had to put the <m>S\not=\emptyset</m> in my formula because
            otherwise the formula would have had us consider the possibility that
            <m>S</m> was empty.

            A group of <m>n</m> students goes to a restaurant carrying backpacks.
            The manager invites everyone to check their backpack at the check desk and everyone does. While they are eating, a child playing in the check room randomly moves around the claim check stubs on the backpacks. We will try to compute the probability that, at the end of the meal, at least one student receives his or her own backpack.  This probability is the fraction of the total number of ways to return the backpacks in which at least one student gets his or her own backpack back.

              For each pair of students (say Mary and Jim, for example) how big is
              the set of backpack distributions in which the students in this pair

            <p>
              If we let <m>A_i</m> be the set of backpack distributions in which student
              <m>i</m> gets the correct backpack, then the number we want to compute is
              the size of the union of the sets <m>A_i</m>. For this purpose we need to
              know, for every subset <m>S\subseteq [n]</m> the size of <m>\cap_{i\in S}A_i</m>.
              That is, we need to know the number of ways to pass out the backpacks
              so that student <m>i</m> gets the correct one for each <m>i</m> in <m>S</m>. It
              won't matter whether or not other students get the correct backpacks,
              so we can just assume that for each <m>i\in S</m>, student <m>i</m> gets the
              correct backpack and then hand out the remaining <m>n-|S|</m> backpacks to
              the remaining <m>n-|S|</m> students in <m>(n-|S|)!</m> ways. Thus <m>(n-|S|)!</m> is
              <m>|\cap_{i:i\in S}A_i|</m>. Using our formula from <xref ref="inclusion-exclusionunion">Problem</xref> we get

      <title>The Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion</title>

      <p>
        The formula you have given in <xref ref="inclusion-exclusionunion">Problem</xref> is
        often called <term>the principle of inclusion and
        exclusion</term><idx><h>inclusion and exclusion principle
        </h><h>for unions of sets</h></idx><idx><h>principle of inclusion and exclusion</h><h>for
        unions of sets</h></idx> for unions of sets. The reason is the pattern in which
        the formula first adds (includes) all the sizes of the sets, then
        subtracts (excludes) all the sizes of the intersections of two sets, then
        adds (includes) all the sizes of the intersections of three sets, and so
        on.   Notice that we haven't yet proved the principle. There are a variety of proofs.  Perhaps one of the most straightforward (though not the most elegant) is an iductive proof that relies on the fact that
        <me>
          A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_n = \left(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_{n-1}\right) \cup A_n

              we are asking for the number of distributions of apples that lie in none of the sets, so we are asking for <m>|\overline{A_1\cup A_2\cup \cdots \cup A_n}|</m>. From the formula you gave in

              <m>S</m> has size <m>s</m>, then <m>S</m> determines a distribution such that all the children in a particular set of size <m>s</m> will get five or more apples. By <xref ref="k-obj-n-recip" />, we can pass out the apples so that the children in a particular set
              <m>\hat S</m> of children get at least five apples as follows: we give everyone in <m>\hat

              children in <m>\binom{k-5s+n-1}{k-5s}= \binom{k-5s+n-1}{n-1}</m> ways. This
              counts the number of ways to give at least five apples to every child in

              <m>|\bigcap_{i\in S}A_i| = = \binom{k-5|S|+n-1}{n-1}</m>. In particular, if <m>S=\emptyset</m>, we get <m>\binom{k+n-1}{n-1}</m>, which is the total number of ways to pass out <m>k</m> identical apples to <m>n</m> children. Applying the formula from <xref ref="compunion" /> gives us

        <hint>
          <p>
            Think in terms of the sets <m>A_i</m> of arrangements of people in which couple <m>i</m> sits side-by-side. What does the union of the sets <m>A_i</m> have to do with the problem?
          </p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We are going to consider arrangements of the couples alternating
            sex around the table. This will be our set <m>A</m>. The set <m>A_i</m> is the set of arrangements in which couple <m>i</m> siets together. We are interested in the number of arrangments that are in none of these sets. Thus for each subset <m>S</m> of <m>[n]</m>, we consider the number of arrangements in <m>\displaystyle\bigcap_{i\colon i\in S} A_i</m>. We distinguish the case that <m>S</m> is empty from the
            others. The number of arrangements with <m>S</m> empty is just the number of ways to seat <m>2n</m>
            couples around the table, alternating sex, but with no other
            restrictions. We can arrange one of the sexes in a circle in <m>n-1!</m> ways
            and then assign the members of the opposite sex to the places between them
            in <m>n!</m> ways, so <m>\displaystyle \left|\bigcap_{i\colon i\in \emptyset} A_i \right| = (n-1)!n!</m>. (Another way to
            get this result is to let one person sit down. This determines the sex
            of the person at each place of the table, so there are <m>(n-1)!</m> ways to
            assign the people of the same sex of the first person, and <m>n!</m> ways to
            assign the people of the opposite. It appears that there are <m>2n</m>
            choices for where the first person sits, but we can break the seating
            charts up into blocks of <m>2n</m> seating charts, each of which gives the
            same circular arrangement. Thus there are <m>(n-1)!n!</m> inequivalent seating arrangments.)
          </p>

          <p>
            Now if
            <m>S</m> is nonempty, and has <m>s</m> members, we seat one of the couples that must
            sit together (say the first in alphabetical order), and this determines the
            sex of the person that must sit at each other place. There are <m>2n</m> pairs
            of adjacent seats where we can seat that couple and two ways they can sit
            in the pair of adjacent seats that we choose. Then we have <m>s-1</m> couples,
            <m>n-s</m> men and <m>n-s</m> women to seat in the remaining places. First we
            arrange the <m>s-1</m> couples and <m>2n-2s</m> identical empty chairs in places at
            the table in <m>(2n-2s+s-1)!/(2n-2s)!=(2n-s-1)!/(2n-2s)!</m> ways. Each couple
            can sit in only one way in the places they have chosen, because the sex of
            the person in a given place has been determined by how the first couple
            sits. The sex of the person in each of the remaining chairs has been
            determined, so we assign the men to their seats in <m>(n-s)!</m> ways and we
            assign the women to their seats in <m>(n-s)!</m> ways. Thus we have
            <m>2\cdot2n(2n-s-1)!(n-s)!^2/(2n-2s)!</m> ways to place the people. But we can
            partition the placements into blocks of <m>2n</m> equivalent placements,
            because shifting everyone the same number of places to the right or left
            gives an equivalent placement. Thus the number of inequivalent seating
            arrangements is

      <title>Counting Derangements</title>
      <p>
        A <term>derangement</term><idx><h>derangement</h></idx> of <m>n</m> elements <m>\{1,2,3,\ldots, n\}</m> is a permutation in which no element is fixed. For example, there are <m>6</m> permutations of the three elements <m>\{1,2,3\}</m>:
        <me>
          123 ~~ 132 ~~ 213 ~~ 231 ~~ 312 ~~ 321.
        </me>
        but most of these have one or more elements fixed: <m>123</m> has all three elements fixed since all three elements are in their original positions, <m>132</m> has the first element fixed (1 is in its original first position), and so on. In fact, the only derangements of three elements are
        <me>
          231 \text{ and } 312.
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        If we go up to 4 elements, there are 24 permutations (because we have 4 choices for the first element, 3 choices for the second, 2 choices for the third leaving only 1 choice for the last). How many of these are derangements? If you list out all 24 permutations and eliminate those which are not derangements, you will be left with just 9 derangements. Let's see how we can get that number using PIE.
      </p>
      <activity>
        <statement>
          <p>
            How many derangements are there of 4 elements?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We count all permutations, and subtract those which are not derangements. There are <m>4! = 24</m> permutations of 4 elements. Now for a permutation to <em>not</em> be a derangement, at least one of the 4 elements must be fixed. There are <m>{4 \choose 1}</m> choices for which single element we fix. Once fixed, we need to find a permutation of the other three elements. There are <m>3!</m> permutations on 3 elements. But now we have counted too many non-derangements, so we must subtract those permutations which fix two elements. There are <m>{4 \choose 2}</m> choices for which two elements we fix, and then for each pair, <m>2!</m> permutations of the remaining elements. But this subtracts too many, so add back in permutations which fix 3 elements, all <m>{4 \choose 3}1!</m> of them. Finally subtract the <m>{4 \choose 4}0!</m> permutations (recall <m>0! = 1</m>) which fix all four elements. All together we get that the number of derangements of 4 elements is:
            <me>
              4! - \left[{4 \choose 1}3! - {4 \choose 2}2! + {4 \choose 3} 1! - {4 \choose 4}0!\right] = 24 - 15 = 9.
            </me>
          </p>
        </solution>
      </activity>
      <p>
        Of course we can use a similar formula to count the derangements of any number of elements. However, the more elements we have, the longer the formula gets. Here is another example:
      </p>
      <activity>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Five gentlemen attend a party, leaving their hats at the door. At the end of the party, they hastily grab hats on their way out. How many different ways could this happen so that none of the gentlemen leave with their own hat?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We are counting derangements on 5 elements. There are <m>5!</m> ways for the gentlemen to grab hats in any order<mdash/>but many of these permutations will result in someone getting their own hat. So we subtract all the ways in which one or more of the men get their own hat. In other words, we subtract the non-derangements. Doing so requires PIE. Thus the answer is:
            <me>
              5! - \left[{5 \choose 1}4! - {5 \choose 2}3! + {5 \choose 3}2! - {5 \choose 4}1! + {5 \choose 5}0!\right].
            </me>
          </p>
        </solution>

      <!-- TODO: Here or in the homework, it would be nice to illustrate the more general closed formula for an n-derangement -->

            An onto function is in none of these sets.
