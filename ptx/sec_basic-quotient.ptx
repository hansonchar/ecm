  <title>The Quotient Principle: Counting under Equivalence</title>

<introduction>
  <!-- Here we will discuss the relationship between combinations and permutations from an advanced mathematical perspective: we are counting equivalence classes.  We will then consider some other examples of this and some non-examples (why you cannot always do this). -->

<p>
  So far we have been able to solve our counting problems simply by use of the sum and product principles, together with the fact that the number of <m>k</m>-element subsets of an <m>n</m>-element set is <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> (the values of which can be found in Pascal's triangle). This means that we have always <em>built up</em> the set of outcomes by combining smaller sets of outcomes combined in various ways.
</p>

<p>
  It is often useful to go the other way.  We could purposely over count the number of outcomes, but in a way that we can recover the correct set.
