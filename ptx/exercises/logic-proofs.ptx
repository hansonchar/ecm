                Direct proof.

                <proof>
                  <p>
                    Let <m>n</m> be an integer. Assume <m>n</m> is even. Then <m>n = 2k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. Thus <m>8n = 16k = 2(8k)</m>. Therefore <m>8n</m> is even.

            <li>
              <p>
                The converse is false. That is, there is an integer <m>n</m> such that <m>8n</m> is even but <m>n</m> is odd. For example, consider <m>n = 3</m>. Then <m>8n = 24</m> which is even but <m>n = 3</m> is odd.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Your <q>friend</q> has shown you a <q>proof</q> he wrote to show that <m>1 = 3</m>. Here is the proof:
        </p>

        <proof>
          <p>
            I claim that <m>1 = 3</m>. Of course we can do anything to one side of an equation as long as we also do it to the other side. So subtract 2 from both sides. This gives <m>-1 = 1</m>. Now square both sides, to get <m>1 = 1</m>. And we all agree this is true.
          </p>
        </proof>

        <p>
          What is going on here? Is your friend's argument valid? Is the argument a proof of the claim <m>1=3</m>? Carefully explain using what we know about logic. Hint: What implication follows from the given proof?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <!-- <solution>
        <p>
          In the proof we assume that <m>1=3</m> and conclude that <m>1=1</m>. So we have proved the implication
          <me>
            1=3 \imp 1=1
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that we actually have a valid proof of this, and that the implication is true (for one thing, the <q>if</q> part is true, so the implication is automatically true). However, what we really want is to converse of this, that <m>1=1 \imp 1=3</m>. But as we know, the converse is not implied by the original implication (it better not be, otherwise we could conclude that 1 actually was 3).
        </p>

        <p>
          Another way to say this: we can never conclude anything about the <q>if</q> part of an implication, since the <q>if</q> part can be true or false even if the implication is true.

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
        Suppose you have a collection of 5-cent stamps and 8-cent stamps. We saw earlier that it is possible to make any amount of postage greater than 27 cents using combinations of both these types of stamps. But, let's ask some other questions:
        <ol>
          <li>
        <p>
        What amounts of postage can you make if you only use an even number of both types of stamps? Prove your answer.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>
        Suppose you made an even amount of postage. Prove that you used an even number of at least one of the types of stamps.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>

        <p>
        Suppose you made exactly 72 cents of postage. Prove that you used at least 6 of one type of stamp.

          Suppose that you would like to prove the following implication:
        </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>For all numbers <m>n</m>, if <m>n</m> is prime then <m>n</m> is solitary.</p>
          </blockquote>
        <p>
          Write out the beginning and end of the argument if you were to prove the statement,
        </p>

              <!-- <solution>
                <p>
                  To solve the above statement using a direct proof we would need to start by assuming that <m>n</m> is a prime number then using logic, logic, logic,... we could conclude that <m>n</m> is solitary.

                By contrapositive

              <!-- <solution>
                <p>
                  To solve by contrapositive: Assume <m>n</m> is not solitary (logic, logic, logic...) and conclude that <m>n</m> is not prime.

            <li>
              <p>
                By contradiction

              <!-- <solution>
                <p>
                  To solve using a proof by contradiction: Assume that <m>n</m> is prime and that <m>n</m> is not solitary (logic, logic, logic...) then either <m>n</m> is not prime or <m>n</m> is solitary (you need to contradict one of your assumptions). Therefore, if <m>n</m> is prime then <m>n</m> is solitary.

          </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
          You do not need to provide details for the proofs (since you do not know what solitary means). However, make sure that you provide the first few and last few lines of the proofs so that we can see that logical structure you would follow.

          Prove that <m>\sqrt 3</m> is irrational.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose <m>\sqrt{3}</m> were rational. Then <m>\sqrt{3} = \frac{a}{b}</m> for some integers <m>a</m> and <m>b \ne 0</m>. Without loss of generality, assume <m>\frac{a}{b}</m> is reduced. Now
            <me>
              3 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}
            </me>
          <me>
            b^2 3 = a^2
          </me>
        </p>
          <p>
            So <m>a^2</m> is a multiple of 3. This can only happen if <m>a</m> is a multiple of 3, so <m>a = 3k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. Then we have
            <me>
              b^2 3 = 9k^2
            </me>
          <me>
            b^2 = 3k^2
          </me>
        </p>
          <p>
            So <m>b^2</m> is a multiple of 3, making <m>b</m> a multiple of 3 as well. But this contradicts our assumption that <m>\frac{a}{b}</m> is in lowest terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            Therefore, <m>\sqrt{3}</m> is irrational.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be integers. Assume <m>a</m> is even and <m>b</m> is a multiple of 3. Then <m>a = 2k</m> and <m>b = 3j</m> for some integers <m>k</m> and <m>j</m>. Now
                  <me>
                    ab = (2k)(3j) = 6(kj)
                  </me>
                </p>

                <p>
                  Since <m>kj</m> is an integer, we have that <m>ab</m> is a multiple of 6.

              The converse is: for all integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, if <m>ab</m> is a multiple of 6, then <m>a</m> is even and <m>b</m> is a multiple of 3. This is false. Consider <m>a = 6</m> and <m>b = 5</m>. Then <m>ab = 30</m> which is a multiple of 6, but <m>b</m> is not divisible by 3 (nor is <m>b</m> even, so this is not just a matter of picking the right one to be <m>b</m>).

        </p>

        <p>
          We will prove the contrapositive: if <m>n</m> is even, then <m>5n</m> is even.
        </p>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>n</m> be an arbitrary integer, and suppose <m>n</m> is even. Then <m>n = 2k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. Thus <m>5n = 5\cdot 2k = 10k = 2(5k)</m>. Since <m>5k</m> is an integer, we see that <m>5n</m> must be even. This completes the proof.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove the statement: For all integers <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m>, if <m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m>, then <m>a</m> or <m>b</m> is even.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <!-- <solution>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose, contrary to stipulation, that there are integers <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> such that <m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m> but <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are both odd. Then <m>a = 2k+1</m> and <m>b = 2j + 1</m> for some integers <m>k</m> and <m>j</m>. We then have
            <me>
              a^2 + b^2 = (2k+1)^2 + (2j+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 + 4j^2 + 4j + 1 = 4(k^2 + j^2 + k + j) + 2
            </me>
          </p>

          <p>
            So <m>c^2 = 4(k^2 + j^2 + k + j) + 2</m>. This means that <m>c^2</m> is even, which can only happen if <m>c</m> is even. But then <m>c^2</m> must be a multiple of 4. However, this is a contradiction because <m>4(k^2 + j^2 + k + j) + 2</m> is not a multiple of 4.  Therefore, if <m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m>, then <m>a</m> or <m>b</m> is even.

                  Suppose that each number only came up 6 or fewer times. So there are at most six 1's, six 2's, and so on. That's a total of 36 dice, so you must not have rolled all 40 dice.

                We can have 9 dice without any four matching or any four being all different: three 1's, three 2's, three 3's. We will prove that whenever you roll 10 dice, you will always get four matching or all being different.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Suppose you roll 10 dice, but that there are NOT four matching rolls. This means at most, there are three of any given value. If we only had three different values, that would be only 9 dice, so there must be 4 different values, giving 4 dice that are all different.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We give a proof by contradiction.
        </p>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose, contrary to stipulation that <m>\log(7)</m> is rational. Then <m>\log(7) = \frac{a}{b}</m> with <m>a</m> and <m>b \ne 0</m> integers. By properties of logarithms, this implies
            <me>
              7 = 10^{\frac{a}{b}}
            </me>
          </p>

          <p>
            Equivalently,
            <me>
              7^b = 10^a
            </me>
          </p>

          <p>
            But this is impossible as any power of 7 will be odd while any power of 10 will be even.  Therefore, <m>\log(7)</m> is irrational.

        </p>
      </statement>
      <!-- <solution>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose there were integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> such that <m>x^2 = 4y + 3</m>. Now <m>x^2</m> must be odd, since <m>4y + 3</m> is odd. Since <m>x^2</m> is odd, we know <m>x</m> must be odd as well. So <m>x = 2k + 1</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. Then <m>x^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 4(k^2 + k) + 1</m>. Therefore we have
            <me>
              4(k^2 + k) + 1 = 4y + 3
            </me>
            which implies
            <me>
              4(k^2 + k) = 4y + 2
            </me>
            and therefore
            <me>
              2(k^2 + k) = 2y + 1.
            </me>
          </p>

          <p>
            But this is a contradiction <ndash /> the left-hand side is even while the right-hand side is odd.  Thus there are no integer solutions.

          We must prove that for any integer greater than 3, if the integer is prime, then it is one more or one less than a multiple of 6. The contrapositive of this statement is that if a number greater than 3 is not one more or one less than a multiple of 6, then it is not prime.

          <p>
            Let <m>n</m> be an integer greater than 3, and assume <m>n \ne 6k+1</m> and <m>n \ne 6k-1</m> for any integer <m>k</m>. Then for some integer <m>k</m>, <m>n = 6k</m>, <m>n = 6k+2</m>, <m>n = 6k+3</m> or <m>n = 6k+4</m>. Case 1: <m>n = 6k</m>. Then <m>n</m> is a multiple of 6, so is not prime. Case 2: <m>n = 6k+2</m>. Then <m>n</m> is even, so not prime. Case 3: <m>n = 6k+3</m>. Then <m>n</m> is a multiple of 3, so not prime. Case 4: <m>n = 6k+4</m>. Then <m>n</m> is even, so not prime. So in any case, <m>n</m> is not prime.

                  You must pick 5 cards. If you picked just 4, you could have two hearts and two spades. However, given any 5 cards, we can be sure that at least two of them will be the same suit, say hearts. Of the remaining three cards, if any of them are also a heart, we will have three hearts. If not, there are two cases to consider. Either all three cards will be of the same suit (in which case we would have three cards of the same suit) or else two suits will be present among the three cards. But those two other suits are not hearts, so those two cards plus one of the hearts will form a set of three cards of all different suits.

          Yes, we can in fact still cover the chessboard with dominoes but only if <m>n</m> is odd. So, my claim is that if <m>n</m> is odd, then I can cover the above chessboard. To prove this, I am going to first notice that if I take away the column and row attached to the missing square, I have created an <m>n-1\times n-1</m> chessboard where <m>n-1</m> is even. By the proof in class, we have shown that that can be completely covered with dominoes. So, now I just need to worry about the row and column I took away. Since <m>n</m> is odd, I know that the row and column are even and thus can be covered by dominoes lined up head to tail. Thus, I have shown that if <m>n</m> is odd then I can completely cover an <m>n\times n</m> chessboard if <m>n</m> is odd.
