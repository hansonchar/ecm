        <statement>
          <p>
            Write out all functions <m>f: \{1,2,3\} \to \{a,b\}</m> (using two-line notation). How many are there? How many are injective? How many are surjective? How many are both?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            There are 8 different functions. In two-line notation these are:

              <me> f = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ a \amp a\amp a \end{pmatrix} \quad f = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ b \amp b \amp b \end{pmatrix}</me>
              <me> f = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ a \amp a\amp b \end{pmatrix} \quad f = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ a \amp b \amp a \end{pmatrix} \quad f = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ b \amp a\amp a \end{pmatrix}
              </me>
              <me>
                \quad f = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ b \amp b \amp a \end{pmatrix} \quad f = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ b \amp a\amp b \end{pmatrix} \quad f = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ a \amp b \amp b \end{pmatrix} </me>


            None of the functions are injective. Exactly 6 of the functions are surjective. No functions are both (since no functions here are injective).

        <solution>
          <p>
            There are 9 functions: you have a choice of three outputs for <m>f(1)</m>, and for each, you have three choices for the output <m>f(2)</m>. Of these functions, 6 are injective, 0 are surjective, and 0 are both:

              f = \twoline{1 \amp 2}{a\amp a} \quad f = \twoline{1 \amp 2}{b \amp b} \quad f = \twoline{1 \amp 2}{c \amp c}

                  <m>f</m> is not injective. To prove this, we must simply find two different elements of the domain which map to the same element of the codomain. Since <m>f(\{1\}) = 1</m> and <m>f(\{2\}) = 1</m>, we see that <m>f</m> is not injective.

                Yes.  If <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> are two different elements of the domain <m>X</m>, then <m>f(x_1)</m> and <m>f(x_2)</m> must be different elements of <m>Y</m>, since <m>f</m> is injective.  Then <m>g(f(x_1))</m> must be different from <m>g(f(x_2))</m> since <m>g</m> is injective.  So no two distinct elements from the domain will have the same image.
              </p></li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Yes.  We know that every element of <m>Z</m> is the image of at least one element from <m>Y</m> under <m>g</m>.  But every element from <m>Y</m> is the image of some element in <m>X</m> under <m>f</m>.  So every element from <m>Z</m> is the image of at least one element from <m>X</m> under <m>g\circ f</m>.

              <li>
                <p>
                  We know that <m>f</m> must be injective, and <m>g</m> could or could not be injective.
                  Note that if <m>f</m> was not injective, then there would be two elements in <m>X</m> that went to the same element in <m>Y</m> and that element would need to go to one element in <m>Z</m>, contradicting that <m>g\circ f</m> was injective.
                  However, consier <m>X = \{1,2\}</m>, <m>Y = \{a, b, c\}</m> and <m>Z = \{5, 6\}</m>, together with <m>f = \twoline{1 \amp 2}{a, b}</m> and <m>g = \twoline{a \amp b \amp c}{5, 6, 6}</m>.
                  It is easy to see that <m>g \circ f</m> is still injective even though <m>g</m> is not.

                <p>
                  Now we know that <m>g</m> must be surjective, but <m>f</m> does not need to be (although it could be).
                  If there is an element in <m>Z</m> that is not the image of anything in <m>Y</m> under <m>g</m>, then that element certainly could not be the image of anything in <m>X</m> under <m>g\circ f</m>.
                  Note that the counterexample from the previous part also shows that <m>f</m> does not need to be surjective to make <m>g\circ f</m> surjective.

                    Let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be elements of the domain <m>\Z</m>. Assume <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>. If <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both even, then <m>f(x) = x+1</m> and <m>f(y) = y+1</m>. Since <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>, we have <m>x + 1 = y + 1</m> which implies that <m>x = y</m>. Similarly, if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both odd, then <m>x - 3 = y-3</m> so again <m>x = y</m>. The only other possibility is that <m>x</m> is even an <m>y</m> is odd (or visa-versa). But then <m>x + 1</m> would be odd and <m>y - 3</m> would be even, so it cannot be that <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>. Therefore if <m>f(x) = f(y)</m> we then have <m>x = y</m>, which proves that <m>f</m> is injective.

There are two cases: First, if <m>y</m> is even, then let <m>n = y+3</m>. Since <m>y</m> is even, <m>n</m> is odd, so <m>f(n) = n-3 = y+3-3 = y</m> as desired. Second, if <m>y</m> is odd, then let <m>n = y-1</m>. Since <m>y</m> is odd, <m>n</m> is even, so <m>f(n) = n+1 = y-1+1 = y</m> as needed. Therefore <m>f</m> is surjective.

The function is almost certainly not injective, because it is likely that two students will get the same grade. The function might be surjective <ndash/> it will be if there is at least one student who gets each grade.

            Yes, as long as the set of cards is the domain and the set of players is the codomain. The function is not injective because multiple cards go to each player. It is surjective since all players get cards.

            This cannot be a function. If the domain were the set of cards, then it is not a function because not every card gets dealt to a player. If the domain were the set of players, it would not be a function because a single player would get mapped to multiple cards. Since this is not a function, it doesn't make sense to say whether it is injective/surjective/bijective.
