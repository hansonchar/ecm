Suppose you have two number cubes with non-standard labels.  The first has 1's on four sides and 2's on the remaining two sides, while the second cube has two 1's and four 2's. You will roll the pair of dice and compute the sum of the numbers rolled.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-236} \hypertarget{p-1306}{}%
How many ways could you roll a 2?  What about a 3?  4?  You should be able to answer these questions by making a \(6\times 6\) addition table (with a lot of repeated row and column headers), but make sure you also think about how the sum and product principles are being used.%
\item\label{task-237} \hypertarget{p-1307}{}%
Expand the polynomial \((4x + 2x^2)(2x + 4x^2)\).  Do this by hand, keeping track of what you get before and after you ``group like terms.''%
\item\label{task-238} \hypertarget{p-1308}{}%
How are the two tasks above related?  What is going on here?%
