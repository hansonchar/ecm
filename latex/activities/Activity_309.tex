Suppose we take a partition of \(k\) into \(n\) parts with largest part \(m\), complement it in the smallest rectangle it will fit into, complement the result in the smallest rectangle it will fit into, and continue the process until we get the partition 1 of one into one part.  What can you say about the partition with which we started?%
