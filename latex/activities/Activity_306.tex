Explain the relationship between the number of partitions of \(k\) into even parts and the number of partitions of \(k\) into parts of even multiplicity, i.e. parts which are each used an even number of times as in (3,3,3,3,2,2,1,1).%

\hypertarget{p-1511}{}%
Draw the partitions of six into even parts. Draw the partitions of six into parts used an even number of times. Look for a relationship between one set of diagrams and the other set of diagrams. If you have trouble, repeat the process using 8 or even 10 in place of 6.%
