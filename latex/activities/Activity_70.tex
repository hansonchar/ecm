Define a bijection \(f:X \to Y\) where \(X\) is the set of lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((k,n-k)\) and \(Y\) is the set of \(n\)-bit strings of weight \(k\). Prove that \(f\) really is a bijection.%
\item\label{task-96} \hypertarget{p-521}{}%
Define a bijection \(f:X \to Y\) where \(X\) is the set of \(n\)-bit strings of weight \(k\) and \(Y\) is set of \(k\)-element subsets of \([n] = \{1,2,3,\ldots, n\}\).  Again, prove that \(f\) is a bijection.%
\item\label{task-97} \hypertarget{p-522}{}%
Can you now conclude that the number of lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((k,n-k)\) is the same as the number of \(k\)-element subsets of \([n]\)?  Can you easily give the bijection (and be sure it is one)?%
