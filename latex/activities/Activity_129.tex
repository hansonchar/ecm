Your answer in \hyperref[compositionagian]{Activity~\ref{compositionagian}} can be expressed as a binomial coefficient. This means it should be possible to interpret a composition as a subset of some set. Find a bijection between compositions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts and certain subsets of some set.  Explain explicitly how to get the composition from the subset and the subset from the composition.%
