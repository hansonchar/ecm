In how many ways can we pass out \(k\) distinct pieces of fruit to \(n\) children (with no restriction on how many pieces of fruit a child may get)?%

\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-56}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-671}{}%
Either by the formula for the number of functions from an \(m\)-element set to an \(n\)-element set or the general product principle, there are \(k^n\) ways. (Each distribution is a function from the set of fruit to the set of children, because each piece of fruit goes to one and only one child.)%
