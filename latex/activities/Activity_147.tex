Given a sequence \((b_n)_{n \ge 1}\) with a quadratic closed formula, say \(b_n = an^2 + bn + c\), what will the closed formula for the sequence of differences be?  That is, what is the closed formula for \(a_n = b_n - b_{n-1}\)?  Why does this show that every quadratic sequence is the sequence of partial sums for some arithmetic sequence?%
