Explain why \(a_n\) satisfies the recurrence \(a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}\).  You will need to use the graphs \(P_n\), \(P_{n-1}\) and \(P_{n-2}\) and their independent sets to do this.  Show how you can ``find'' the independent sets of \(P_{n-1}\) and \(P_{n-2}\) among the independent set of \(P_{n}\) (perhaps using some sort of bijection).%
