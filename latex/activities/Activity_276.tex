In how many ways can we partition \(k\) items into \(n\) blocks so that we have \(a_i\) blocks of size \(i\) for each \(i\)? That is, given the type vector \((a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k)\), how many partitions of \([k]\) into \(n\) blocks have that type vector.%

\hypertarget{p-1414}{}%
Suppose we make a list of the \(k\) items. We take the first \(a_1\) elements to be the blocks of size 1. How many elements do we need to take to get \(a_2\) blocks of size two? Which elements does it make sense to choose for this purpose?%
