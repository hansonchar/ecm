Suppose you have \(n\) bow ties, \(n\) fezzes and \(n\) pairs of sun glasses and you want to select three of the accessories.  There are \(\binom{3n}{3}\) ways to do this.  Or you could  select three bow ties, three fezzes or three pairs of sun glasses in \(3 \binom{n}{3}\) ways, or two of one and one of the other in  \(6n \binom{n}{2}\) ways, or one of each in \(n^3\) ways.%
