This one is a little tougher. First rewrite as \(n^{3} = \binom{3n}{3} - 3 \binom{n}{3} - 6n \binom{n}{2}\). Suppose you have \(n\) men, \(n\) women and \(n\) children and you want to select triples consisting of one man, one woman and one child. There are \(n^{3}\) ways to do this, just pick one from each group. Alternatively, select 3 of the \(3n\) people in \(\binom{3n}{3}\) ways and delete the ``bad'' ones. Delete the ones where you selected all three from one group \textemdash{} there are \(3 \binom{n}{3}\) of these. Now delete those where you had two from one group and one from another \textemdash{} there are \(2n \binom{n}{2} + 2n \binom{n}{2} + 2n \binom{n}{2}\) of these.%
