Consider the sequence \((a_n)_{n \ge 1}\) which satisfies the recurrence relation \(a_n = \sum_{i = 1}^{n-1} a_i\).  That is, each term of the sequence is the sum of \emph{all} previous terms in the sequence.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-918}{}%
Find a recurrence relation in terms of only the previous term for this sequence.  Prove that you are correct.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Hint}.\hypertarget{hint-101}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-919}{}%
Try this out with some different initial conditions.  Once you see what the recurrence should be, proving it by induction should be easy.%
