The ``Towers of Hanoi'' puzzle has three rods rising from a rectangular base with \(n\) rings of different sizes stacked in decreasing order of size on one rod. A legal move consists of moving a ring from one rod to another so that it does not land on top of a smaller ring. If \(m_n\) is the number of moves required to move all the rings from the initial rod to another rod that you choose, give a recurrence for \(m_n\).%

\hypertarget{p-899}{}%
Suppose you already knew the number of moves needed to solve the puzzle with \(n-1\) rings.%
