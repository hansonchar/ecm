Let \((a_n)_{n \le 0}\) satisfy \(a_n = a_{n-1} + 3\) with \(a_0 = 2\).  For example, \(a_n\) might give the number of push-ups you can do \(n\) days into your training, assuming you can do 3 more push-ups each day, if you could do 2 push-ups before you started training.  Find a closed formula for \(a_n\) and justify your answer.  Show how the recurrence relation is used.%
