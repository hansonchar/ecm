What is the generating function (using \(q\) as the variable) for the number of partitions of an integer into distinct parts, that is, in which each part is used at most once?%

\hypertarget{p-1627}{}%
\((1 + q^2 + q^4 )(1 + q^3 + q^9 )\) is the generating function for partitions of an integer into at most two twos and at most two threes. (This is intentionally the same hint as in the previous problem, but it has a different point in this problem.)%

\(\displaystyle (1+q)(1+q^2)(1+q^3)\cdots=
\prod_{i=1}^\infty(1+q^i)\).%
