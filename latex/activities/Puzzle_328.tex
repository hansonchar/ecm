While walking through a fictional forest, you encounter three trolls guarding a bridge. Each is either a \emph{knight}, who always tells the truth, or a \emph{knave}, who always lies. The trolls will not let you pass until you correctly identify each as either a knight or a knave. Each troll makes a single statement:%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-3}{}
\hypertarget{p-1762}{}%
Troll 1: If I am a knave, then there are exactly two knights here.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1763}{}%
Troll 2: Troll 1 is lying.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1764}{}%
Troll 3: Either we are all knaves or at least one of us is a knight.%
\end{quote}
\hypertarget{p-1765}{}%
Which troll is which? \index{self reference|see{reference, self}} \index{reference, self|see{self reference}}%
