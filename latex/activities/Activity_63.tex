Treating Pascal's Triangle as nothing more than a triangular array of numbers, what do you notice about it?  Are there any patterns to the numbers? Try to find some patterns and then see if you can answer (or have already answered) the following:%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-70} \hypertarget{p-474}{}%
How are the entries in the triangle found?  What would the next row down be?%
\item\label{task-71} \hypertarget{p-475}{}%
What is the sum of the entries in the \(n\)th row?%
\item\label{task-72} \hypertarget{p-476}{}%
What is \(1 - 5 + 10 - 10 + 5 - 1\)?  What pattern is this an example of, and does it always work?%
\item\label{task-73} \hypertarget{p-477}{}%
What is \(1 + 3 + 6 + 10 + 15\)?  What pattern is this an example of, and does it always work?%
\item\label{task-74} \hypertarget{p-478}{}%
What is \(1+ 7 + 15 + 10 + 1\)?  What pattern is this an example of, and does it always work?%
\item\label{task-75} \hypertarget{p-479}{}%
Are there any groups of numbers in the triangle that are particularly recognizable?%
\end{enumerate}
