Suppose we wish to place \(k\) distinct books onto the shelves of a bookcase with \(n\) shelves. For simplicity, assume for now that all of the books would fit on any of the shelves. Also, let's imagine pushing the books on a shelf as far to the left as we can, so that we are only thinking about how the books sit relative to each other, not about the exact places where we put the books. Since the books are distinct, we can think of the first book, the second book and so on.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-161} \hypertarget{p-826}{}%
How many places are there where we can place the first book?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\item\label{task-162} \hypertarget{p-828}{}%
When we place the second book, if we decide to place it on the shelf that already has a book, does it matter if we place it to the left or right of the book that is already there?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\item\label{task-163} \hypertarget{p-830}{}%
How many places are there where we can place the second book?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Hint}.\hypertarget{hint-80}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-831}{}%
If you decide to put it on a shelf that already has a book, you have two choices of where to put it on that shelf.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\item\label{task-164} \hypertarget{p-833}{}%
Once we have \(i-1\) books placed, if we want to place book \(i\)  on a shelf that already has some books, is sliding it in to the left of all the books already there different from placing it to the right of all the books already or between two books already there?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\item\label{task-165} \hypertarget{p-835}{}%
In how many ways may we place the \(i\)th book into the bookcase?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Hint}.\hypertarget{hint-81}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-836}{}%
Among all the places you could put books, on all the shelves, how many are to the immediate left of some book? How many other places are there?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\item\label{task-166} \hypertarget{p-838}{}%
In how many ways may we place all the books?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\end{enumerate}
