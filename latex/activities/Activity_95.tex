Suppose you have a set of \(m\) bow ties and \(n\) fezzes and you want to form fez-bow tie outfits. This can clearly be done in \(mn\) ways. Or, you could choose 2 from the total of \(m + n\) items and delete the bow tie only pairs (there are \(\binom{m}{2}\) of these) and delete the fez only pairs (also \(\binom{n}{2}\) of these). Since we have counted this one set with two different expressions (the left hand side and the right hand side of the identity), those expressions are equal.%
