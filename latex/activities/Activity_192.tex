Consider the graph \(P_n\) (a path with \(n\) edges and \(n+1\) vertices).  Call one of the endpoints of the path \(v\).  How many walks of length \(2n\) start and stop at \(v\)?  Recall a walk in a graph is a sequence of adjacent vertices (think of tracing along edges of the graph), that does allow for repeated vertices.%
