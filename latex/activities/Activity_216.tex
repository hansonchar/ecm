In a biology lab study of the effects of basic fertilizer ingredients on plants, 16 plants are treated with potash, 16 plants are treated with phosphate, and among these plants, eight are treated with both phosphate and potash. No other treatments are used. How many plants receive at least one treatment? If 32 plants are studied, how many receive no treatment?%
