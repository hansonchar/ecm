A roller coaster car has \(n\) rows of seats, each of which has room for two people. If \(n\) men and \(n\) women get into the car with a man and a woman in each row, in how many ways may they choose their seats?%

\((n!)^2 2^n\).  First, form two lines of \(n\) women and \(n\) men.  Each of these lines can be formed in \(n!\) ways, so the total number of pairs of lines is \((n!)^2\).  Now have the newly formed couples enter the coaster in order, but for each pair, decide whether the woman sits to the left or the right of the man.  So for each pair, we have 2 choices, for a total of \(2^n\) ways the lined-up couples can sit in the coaster car.%
