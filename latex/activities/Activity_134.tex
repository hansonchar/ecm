Let \(a_n\) be the number of subsets of \([n]\).  Find a recurrence relation for the sequence \((a_n)_{n \ge 0}\).  Prove the recurrence relation is correct.%

\hypertarget{p-893}{}%
You should ask yourself, how are the subsets of \([n]\) related to the subsets of \([n-1]\).  If you are stuck, you could always ``cheat'' and use your knowledge of the value of \(a_n\), but try to do this without thinking about that.%
