Draw as many fundamentally different examples of bipartite graphs which do NOT have perfect matchings. Your goal is to find all the possible obstructions to a graph having a perfect  matching. Write down the \emph{necessary} conditions for a graph to have a matching (that is, fill in the blank: If a graph has a matching, then \fillin{4.545454545454546}). Then ask yourself whether these conditions are sufficient (is it true that if \fillin{4.545454545454546}, then the graph has a matching?).%
