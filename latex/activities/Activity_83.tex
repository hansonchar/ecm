\hypertarget{p-656}{}%
Suppose the magician hands you 4 cards (the Ace, King, Queen, and Jack of clubs) and asks you to select any two cards (placing them face down in a stack).  How many choices do you have?  Assume the order the cards are placed down matters.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-125} \hypertarget{p-657}{}%
If you divide the task into two sub-tasks, what are they?  How many ways can you complete the first task?  How many ways can you complete the second?  What is the final answer?%
\item\label{task-126} \hypertarget{p-658}{}%
If you think of this problem as counting a Cartesian product, what is set \(A\)?  What is set \(B\)?  What is wrong?%
\end{enumerate}
