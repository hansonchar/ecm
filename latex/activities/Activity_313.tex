Suppose \(\lambda\) is a partition of \(k\) into \(n\) distinct parts. Either 1 is one of those parts or not. Thus if we subtract 1 from each part, we either get a partition of \(k-n\) into \(n-1\) parts or a partition of \(k-n\) into \(n\) parts. If \(\lambda\) and \(\lambda'\) are different partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) distinct parts, they go to different partitions. Each partition of \(k-n\) into \(n-1\) parts or \(n\) parts can be gotten in this way from a corresponding partition of \(k\) into \(n\) parts. Thus we have a bijective correspondence and \(q_n(k)=q_{n-1}(k-n) + q_{n}(k-n)\).%
