Suppose we wish to place the books in \hyperref[bookcase]{Activity~\ref{bookcase}} (satisfying the assumptions we made there) so that each shelf gets at least one book. Now in how many ways may we place the books? (Hint: how can you make sure that each shelf gets at least one book before you start the process described in \hyperref[bookcase]{Activity~\ref{bookcase}}?)%
