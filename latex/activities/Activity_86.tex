A tennis club has \(2n\) members. We want to pair up the members by twos for singles matches.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-131} \hypertarget{p-635}{}%
In how many ways may we pair up all the members of the club? (Hint: consider the cases of 2, 4, and 6 members.)%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Hint}.\hypertarget{hint-40}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-636}{}%
Suppose you have a list in alphabetical order of names of the members of the club. In how many ways can you pair up the first person on the list? In how many ways can you pair up the next person who isn't already paired up?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\item\label{task-132} \hypertarget{p-638}{}%
Suppose that in addition to specifying who plays whom, for each pairing we say who serves first.  Now in how many ways may we specify our pairs?%
\end{enumerate}
