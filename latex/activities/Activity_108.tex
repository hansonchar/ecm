Let's count the number of subsets of \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\) of size 3.  Of course we already know the answer should be \(\binom{5}{3}\), which we can see in Pascal's triangle is equal to 10.  What might you try if you didn't already know this?%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-142} \hypertarget{p-773}{}%
You might first guess that the answer is \(5\cdot 4 \cdot 3\) since there are 5 choices for which element you put in your subset first, then  4 choices for the next element, and 3 choices for the last element.  Write down all 60 of the outcomes you get by counting the ``subsets'' this way.\footnote{This might seem like a lot of busy work, but your efforts will be rewarded.\label{fn-9}}%
\item\label{task-143} \hypertarget{p-774}{}%
One of the subsets we are actually interested in is \(\{a,c,d\}\).  How many of the outcomes you listed above correspond to this set?  How many outcomes correspond to the set \(\{c,d,e\}\)?%
\item\label{task-144} \hypertarget{p-775}{}%
Explain why every subset corresponds to the same number of permutations.  Then use this to count the total number of subsets correctly.%
