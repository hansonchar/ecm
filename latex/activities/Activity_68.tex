\item\label{task-88} \hypertarget{p-507}{}%
Explain why the number of lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((k,n-k)\) is the same as number of \(n\)-bit strings of weight \(k\). You do not need to give a formal proof here, just explain the idea.%
\item\label{task-89} \hypertarget{p-508}{}%
Explain why the number of \(n\)-bit strings of weight \(k\) is the same as the number of \(k\)-element subsets of \([n] = \{1,2,3,\ldots, n\}\).   Again, an informal argument is fine.%
\item\label{task-90} \hypertarget{p-509}{}%
Explain why the number of \(k\)-element subsets of \([n]\) is the same as the coefficient of \(x^ky^{n-k}\) in the expansion of \((x+y)^n\).%

\hypertarget{p-510}{}%
This is a little harder.  It might help to notice that there is really nothing special about \([n]\) except that it contains \(n\) elements.  In fact, what can you say about the number of \(k\)-element subsets of \emph{any} \(n\)-element set?  Then, what \(n\)-element set would we look at when expanding \((x+y)^n\)?%
