Suppose you have 17 books strewn around your room.  You resolve to get organized.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-133} \hypertarget{p-659}{}%
You decide to throw 10 books in the trash.  How many choices do you have for which books to get rid of?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Hint}.\hypertarget{hint-45}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-660}{}%
We are not necessarily looking for a numerical answer here, but you should be able to express the answer using notation we have developed already.  Or by using some sort of triangle.%
\item\label{task-134} \hypertarget{p-661}{}%
You think twice about tossing your books, and you find a bookshelf that can hold 10 books.  How many ways can you fill the bookshelf?%
\item\label{task-135} \hypertarget{p-662}{}%
How many ways could you fill the 10 book bookshelf if the books were arranged alphabetically?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Hint}.\hypertarget{hint-46}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-663}{}%
Should your answer be larger or smaller than if the books could be in any order?  How is this any different from throwing the books away?%
\end{enumerate}
