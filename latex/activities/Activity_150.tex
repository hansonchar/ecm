\hypertarget{p-955}{}%
Find a closed formula for the \(n\)th Fibonacci number.  This is called Binet's Formula.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Hint}.\hypertarget{hint-109}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-956}{}%
You will need to use the quadratic formula to find the roots, and some careful algebra to find the coefficients.  The closed formula will include \(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\), the \emph{Golden Ratio}.%
