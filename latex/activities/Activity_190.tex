Place \(2n\) points on the circumference of a circle and draw \(n\)  non-intersecting chords.  How many ways can you do this?  Equivalently, if \(2n\) people stand in a circle, how many ways can everyone shake hands with one other person so that no one's arms cross?  Assume these people have arbitrarily long arms.%
