Show that the number of partitions of \(k\) into four parts equals the number of partitions of \(3k\) into four parts of size at most \(k-1\) (or \(3k-4\) into four parts of size at most \(k-2\) or \(3k-4\) into four parts of size at most \(k\)).%

Draw a partition of ten into four parts. Assume each square has area one. Then draw a rectangle of area 40 enclosing your diagram that touches the top of your diagram, the left side of your diagram and the bottom of your diagram. How does this rectangle give you a partition of 30 into four parts?%
