Suppose an apple has 40 calories, a pear has 60 calories, and a banana has 80 calories. What should you substitute for \(A\), \(P\), and \(B\) in \hyperref[zerotothreefruits]{Activity~\ref{zerotothreefruits}} in order to get a polynomial in which the coefficient of \(x^n\) is the number of ways to choose a selection of fruit with a total of \(n\) calories?%

\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-169}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-1328}{}%
Substitute \(x^{40}\) for \(A\), \(x^{60}\) for \(P\), and \(x^{80}\) for \(B\).%
