Explain why each of the following counting problems are also answered in the form \(\mchoose{n}{k}\) (and say what \(n\) and \(k\) are).  You should be able to explain why all of these are equivalent to each other, and then find a bijection from any of them to the set of \(k\)-element multisets of \([n]\).%

\item\label{task-159} \hypertarget{p-856}{}%
How many non-negative integer solutions are there to the equation \(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 10\)?%
\item\label{task-160} \hypertarget{p-857}{}%
How many ways are there to distribute 7 identical cookies to 5 kids? Some kids might not get any cookies, but you should distribute all 7 cookies.%
\item\label{task-161} \hypertarget{p-858}{}%
How many ways can you put 10 identical books on the 4 shelves of a bookcase?  Assume each shelf could hold up to 10 books, and that all the books are always shoved all the way to the left (so we are not worried about where the books are on an individual shelf, just which shelf they go on).%
