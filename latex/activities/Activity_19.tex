When a connected graph can be drawn without any edges crossing, it is called \terminology{planar}. When a planar graph is drawn in this way, it divides the plane into regions called \terminology{faces}. \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-27}{}\hypertarget{p-201}{}%
Draw, if possible, two different planar graphs with the same number of vertices, edges, and faces.%
\item\hypertarget{li-28}{}\hypertarget{p-202}{}%
Draw, if possible, two different planar graphs with the same number of vertices and edges, but a different number of faces.%
