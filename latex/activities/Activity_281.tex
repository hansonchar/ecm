In how many ways may we label the elements of a \(k\)-element set with \(n\) distinct labels (numbered 1 through \(n\)) so that label \(i\) is used \(j_i\) times? (If we think of the labels as \(y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n\), then we can rephrase this question as follows.  How many functions are there from a \(k\)-element set \(K\) to a set \(N=\{y_1,y_2,\ldots y_n\}\) so that \(y_i\) is the image of \(j_i\) elements of \(K\)?) This number is called a \terminology{multinomial coefficient}\index{multinomial coefficient}\index{coefficient!multinomial} and denoted by%
\begin{equation*}
\binom{k}{j_1,j_2,\ldots, j_n}.
\end{equation*}
