Can every positive integer be written as a sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers?  In fact, can every positive integer be written as a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers?  Further, can every positive integer be written as a sum of at most 5 non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers?  Prove your answers (i.e., either give a proof or provide a counterexample).%
