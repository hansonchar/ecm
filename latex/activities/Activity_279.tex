In how many ways may the caterer distribute the nine sandwiches into three identical bags so that each bag gets exactly three? Answer this question.%

\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-208}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-1474}{}%
\(\binom{9}{3}\binom{6}{3}\binom{3}{3}/3!\). First we choose three sandwiches for bag 1, then three for bag 2, and put the remainder in bag 3. However, it doesn't matter which bags the sandwiches are in so we have counted each partition \(3!\) times.%
