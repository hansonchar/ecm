In how many ways may we distribute \(k\) identical apples to \(n\) children so that no child gets more than four apples?%

Notice that it is straightforward to figure out how many ways we may pass out the apples so that child \(i\) gets five or more apples: give five apples to child \(i\) and then pass out the remaining apples however you choose. And if  we want to figure out how many ways we may pass out the apples so that a given set \(C\) of children each get five or more apples, we give five to each child in \(C\) and then pass out the remaining \(k-5|C|\) apples however we choose.%
