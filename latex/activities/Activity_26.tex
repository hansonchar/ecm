\hypertarget{p-277}{}%
For the complete graphs \(K_n\), we would like to be able to say something about the number of vertices, edges, and (if the graph is planar) faces.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-33} \hypertarget{p-278}{}%
How many vertices does \(K_3\) have? How many edges?  If \(K_3\) is planar, how many faces should it have?%
\item\label{task-34} \hypertarget{p-279}{}%
How many vertices, edges and (if planar) faces would \(K_4\), \(K_5\) and \(K_{23}\) each have?%
\item\label{task-35} \hypertarget{p-280}{}%
What about complete bipartite graphs? How many vertices, edges, and faces (if it were planar) does \(K_{7,4}\) have?%
\end{enumerate}
