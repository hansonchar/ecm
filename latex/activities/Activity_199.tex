\item\label{task-211} \hypertarget{p-1086}{}%
Write down (if you haven't already) all 6 partitions of \([4]\) into \(3\) blocks.  Break these into two cases by where 4 is: is 4 is solitary confinement (in a singleton set) or does he have a cellmate?%
\item\label{task-212} \hypertarget{p-1087}{}%
How could you take the \(S(4,2) = 7\) partitions of \([4]\) into 2 sets and the \(S(4,3) = 6\) partitions of \([4]\) into 3 sets and form all the \(S(5,3) = 25\) partitions of \([5]\) into \(3\) sets?%
