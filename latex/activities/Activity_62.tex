For many applications of matchings, it makes sense to use bipartite graphs. You might wonder, however, whether there is a way to find matchings in graphs in general.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-69} \hypertarget{p-491}{}%
For which \(n\) does the complete graph \(K_n\) have a matching?%
\item\label{task-70} \hypertarget{p-492}{}%
Prove that if a graph has a matching, then \(\card{V}\) is even.%
\item\label{task-71} \hypertarget{p-493}{}%
Is the converse true?  That is, do all graphs with \(\card{V}\) even have a matching?%
\item\label{task-72} \hypertarget{p-494}{}%
What if we also require the matching condition?  Prove or disprove: If a graph with an even number of vertices satisfies \(\card{N(S)} \ge \card{S}\) for all \(S \subseteq V\), then the graph has a matching.%
