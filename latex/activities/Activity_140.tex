Let \(c_n\) be the number of independent sets of vertices in the cycle \(C_n\).  For consistency, label the vertices of \(C_n\) with the integers \(1, 2, \ldots, n\) and assume \(E = \{(i, i+1) \st 1 \le i \lt n\} \cup \{(n, 1)\}\). Find a recurrence relation for \((c_n)_{n\ge 4}\) and prove you are correct.%

\hypertarget{p-928}{}%
Consider what happens to \(C_n\) when you \terminology{contract} along the edge \((n,1)\) (in other words, remove the edge and glue the vertices \(1\) and \(n\) together).  This should give you a copy of \(C_{n-1}\).  Now think about which independent sets in \(C_n\) are not represented by independent sets in \(C_{n-1}\).%
