A cube\index{cube} is an example of a convex polyhedron. It contains 6 identical squares for its faces, 8 vertices, and 12 edges. The cube is a \terminology{regular polyhedron} (also known as a \terminology{Platonic solid}\index{Platonic solids}) because each face is an identical regular polygon and each vertex joins an equal number of faces.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-314}{}%
There are exactly four other regular polyhedra: the tetrahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron with 4, 8, 12 and 20 faces respectively. How many vertices and edges do each of these have?%
