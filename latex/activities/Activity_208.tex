Find \(p_3(6)\) by finding all partitions of 6 into 3 parts. What does this say about the number of ways to put six identical apples into three identical bags so that each bag has at least one apple?%

\hypertarget{p-1191}{}%
\(6=4+1+1\), \(6=3+2+1\), \(6=2+2+2\), so \(P(6,3)=3\). This says there are three ways to put six identical apples into three identical bags so that each bag gets at least one apple.%
