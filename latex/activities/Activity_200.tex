Now generalize.  In a partition of the set \([k]\), the number \(k\) is either in a block by itself, or it is not.  Find a two variable recurrence for \(S(n,k)\), valid for \(n\) and \(k\) larger than one.%

The number of partitions of \([k]\) into \(n\) parts in which \(k\) is not in a block relates to the number of partitions of \(k-1\) into some number of blocks in a way that involves \(n\). With this in mind, review how you proved Pascal's (recurrence) equation.%
