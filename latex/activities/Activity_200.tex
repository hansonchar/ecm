Now generalize.  In a partition of the set \([k]\), the number \(k\) is either in a block by itself, or it is not.  Find a two variable recurrence for \(S(k,n)\), valid for \(k\) and \(n\) larger than one.%

\hypertarget{p-1156}{}%
The number of partitions of \([k]\) into \(n\) parts in which \(k\) is in a block with other elements of \([k]\) is equal \(n\) times the number of partitions of \([k-1]\) into \(n\) blocks, because \(k\) could be in any of the \(n\) parts, and since it is in a block with other elements of \([k-1]\), removing it leaves a partition of \([k-1]\) into \(n\) blocks. The number of partitions of \([k]\) into \(n\) blocks in which \(k\) is in a block by itself is the number of partitions of \([k]\) into \(n-1\) blocks, because you can get any such partition by deleting the block containing \(k\) from a partition of \([k]\) in which \(k\) is in a block by itself. Thus \(S(k,n) = S(k-1,n-1) + nS(k-1,n)\).%
