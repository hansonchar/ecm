Find a graph that has chromatic number 3 even though it does not contain \(K_3\) as a subgraph.%

Find a graph that has chromatic number 4 even though it does not contain \(K_4\) as a subgraph.%

\hypertarget{p-379}{}%
Modify your \(K_3\)-free graph with chromatic number 3.%
\item\label{task-57} \hypertarget{p-380}{}%
Challenge: Find a graph that has chromatic number 4 even though it does not contain \(K_3\) as a subgraph.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Hint}.\hypertarget{hint-17}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-381}{}%
The smallest such graph contains 11 vertices.  Try starting with \(C_5\) and adding vertices creating a lot of odd cycles.%
