Extend Stirling's triangle enough to allow you to answer the following question and answer it. (Don't fill in the rows all the way; the work becomes quite tedious if you do. Only fill in what you need to answer this question.) A caterer is preparing three bag lunches for hikers. The caterer has nine different sandwiches. In how many ways can these nine sandwiches be distributed into three identical lunch bags so that each bag gets at least one?%

We need \(S(9,3)\). Thus we need to extend our table for four more rows, but only out to the column labeled 3. These rows are 6,0,1,31,90, 7,0,1,63,301, 7,0,1,127,966, 8,0,1,255,3025, 9,0,1,511,9330. Thus there are 9330 ways to distribute the sandwiches into the lunch bags.%
