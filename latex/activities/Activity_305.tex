A partition is called \terminology{self-conjugate}\index{self-conjugate partition}\index{partition of an integer!self conjugate} if it is equal to its conjugate. Find a relationship between the number of self-conjugate partitions of \(k\) and the number of partitions of \(k\) into distinct odd parts.%

\hypertarget{p-1507}{}%
Draw all self conjugate partitions of integers less than or equal to 8.  Draw all partitions of integers less than or equal to 8 into distinct odd parts (many of these will have just one part). Now try to see how to get from one set of drawings to the other in a consistent way.%
