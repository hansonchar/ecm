I'm thinking of a polyhedron containing 12 faces. Seven are triangles and four are quadrilaterals. The polyhedron has 11 vertices including those around the mystery face. How many sides does the last face have?%

\hypertarget{p-327}{}%
Say the last polyhedron has \(n\) edges, and also \(n\) vertices. The total number of edges the polyhedron has then is \((7 \cdot 3 + 4 \cdot 4 + n)/2 = (37 + n)/2\). In particular, we know the last face must have an odd number of edges. We also have that \(v = 11 \).  By Euler's formula, we have \(11 - (37+n)/2 + 12 = 2\), and solving for \(n\) we get \(n = 5\), so the last face is a pentagon.%
