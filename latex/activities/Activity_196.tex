Suppose you have \(3\) distinct books you want to put in \(5\) identical boxes.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-204} \hypertarget{p-1107}{}%
How many ways can you do this if each box can have at most one book?%
\item\label{task-205} \hypertarget{p-1108}{}%
How many ways can you do this if any box can have any number of books?  You might want to consider three cases: one, two, or three boxes are used.  Assume we do not care about the order in which the books are placed inside boxes.%
\item\label{task-206} \hypertarget{p-1109}{}%
Describe the outcomes we are counting in abstract mathematical terms.  What sort of mathematical objects are we counting?%
