Do a proof by contradiction.  What is the smallest number of edges such a graph would possess?%

Suppose this were not the case. Then there would be a graph with \(v\) vertices, each with degree 6 or more. At a minimum then, there would be \(6v/2 = 3v\) edges, so \(e \ge 3v\). By the previous exercise, we also have that \(e \le 3v - 6\). But these two facts are contradictory. Thus any planar graph must have a vertex of degree 5 or less.%
