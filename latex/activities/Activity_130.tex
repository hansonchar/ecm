Explain the connection between compositions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts and the problem of distributing \(k\) identical objects to \(n\) recipients so that each recipient gets at least one.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-88}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-897}{}%
Since the recipients are distinct, we can think of them as a first recipient, a second, and so on. Given a composition of \(k\) into \(n\) parts, let the \(i\)th element of the list be the number of objects given to recipient number \(i\).%
