The number of \(n\)-bit strings of weight \(k\) is \(\binom{n}{k}\), so a combination.  But in determining one bit string from another, all that matters is the order in which the \(k\) 1's and \(n-k\) 0's appear.  So does order matter?  In what sense does it not?%

Think about what \(P(n,k)\) would count when building a bit string.  Why does it make sense to quotient out by \(k!\)?%
