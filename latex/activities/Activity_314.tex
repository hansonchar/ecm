\hypertarget{p-1552}{}%
For any partition of \(k\) into parts \(\lambda_1\), \(\lambda_2\), etc. we can get a partition of \(k\) into odd parts by factoring the highest power of two that we can from each \(\lambda_i\), writing \(\lambda_i = \gamma_i\cdot 2^k_i\).  Why is \(\gamma_i\) odd? Now partition \(k\) into \(2^{k_1}\) parts of size \(\gamma_1\), \(2^{k_2}\) parts of size \(\gamma_2\), etc. and you have a partition of \(k\) into odd parts.%
