\item\label{task-167} \hypertarget{p-843}{}%
In some sort of manufacturing mishap, your set of magnetic letters contains only the first 7 letters of the alphabet, and for some reason 5 identical exclamation marks.  How many ways can you arrange all 12 magnets in a single line?  (one such line is BG!AD!!!FEC!).%
\item\label{task-168} \hypertarget{p-844}{}%
What does this question have to do with placing \(7\) distinct books on \(6\) shelves?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Hint}.\hypertarget{hint-82}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-845}{}%
Note, there are 5 exclamation marks, but 6 shelves.%
\item\label{task-169} \hypertarget{p-846}{}%
Oh no! Your 5 year old left the 7 magnetic letters in the oven too long and now they are all identical blobs of plastic.  How many strings of the 12 magnets can you make now?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Hint}.\hypertarget{hint-83}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-847}{}%
One such string is *!!***!*!*!, which looks a lot like 01100010101.%
\item\label{task-170} \hypertarget{p-848}{}%
What sort of distribution problem does the previous task correspond to?  Write a question about books and shelves that has the same answer.%
