Recall that a \terminology{tree} is a connected graph with no cycles.  We wish to prove that every tree with \(v = n\) vertices has \(e = n-1\) edges.  (This is actually a special case of Euler's formula for planar graphs, as a tree will always be a planar graph with 1 face).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-26} \hypertarget{p-241}{}%
First, prove a lemma (not using induction): every tree contains at least two vertices of degree 1.%

\hypertarget{p-242}{}%
Look at paths in the tree.  Let \(v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_n\) be a path of maximal length.  What can you say about \(v_0\) and \(v_n\)?%
\item\label{task-27} \hypertarget{p-243}{}%
We will give a proof by induction on the number of vertices in a tree.  What should the base case be?  Prove it.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Hint}.\hypertarget{hint-5}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-244}{}%
What is the smallest number of vertices that make sense?  You will need to prove that \emph{all} trees with one vertex have the correct number of edges.  This should be very easy.%
\item\label{task-28} \hypertarget{p-245}{}%
Now for the inductive case.  Start with an arbitrary tree \(T\) with \(n\) vertices and assume that \emph{all} trees with \(n-1\) vertices have \(n-2\) edges (why is the the right thing to assume)?  Prove that \(T\) has \(n-1\) edges.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Hint}.\hypertarget{hint-6}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-246}{}%
To get to a tree with \(n-1\) vertices, you need to \emph{trim} \(T\) somehow.  Which vertex should you get rid of?  What will this do to the number of edges?%
\end{enumerate}
