Recall that a \terminology{tree} is a connected graph with no cycles.  We wish to prove that every tree with \(v = n\) vertices has \(e = n-1\) edges.  (This is actually a special case of Euler's formula for planar graphs, as a tree will always be a planar graph with 1 face).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-28} \hypertarget{p-257}{}%
First, prove a lemma (not using induction): every tree contains at least two vertices of degree 1.%
~\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{a-23.a}{[hint]}\hypertarget{q-23.a}{}}\item\label{task-29} \hypertarget{p-259}{}%
We will give a proof by induction on the number of vertices in a tree.  What should the base case be?  Prove it.%
~\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{a-23.b}{[hint]}\hypertarget{q-23.b}{}}\item\label{task-30} \hypertarget{p-261}{}%
Now for the inductive case.  Start with an arbitrary tree \(T\) with \(n\) vertices and assume that \emph{all} trees with \(n-1\) vertices have \(n-2\) edges (why is the the right thing to assume)?  Prove that \(T\) has \(n-1\) edges.%
