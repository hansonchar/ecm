Let \(b_n\) be the number of bijections from an \(n\)-element set to and \(n\)-element set.  Find a recurrence relation for the sequence \((b_n)_{n \ge 1}\) and prove you are correct.%

\hypertarget{p-925}{}%
To determine a bijection \(f:[n] \to [n]\), you could first say what \(f(n)\) is.  What do you still need to do?  Your answer to this question should be one single step (that inductively, you know how to do).%
