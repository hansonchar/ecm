If we have five identical pennies, five identical nickels, five identical dimes, and five identical quarters, give the picture enumerator for the combinations of coins we can form and convert it to a generating function for the number of ways to make \(k\) cents with the coins we have. Do the same thing assuming we have an unlimited supply of pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters.%
