\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-101} \hypertarget{p-566}{}%
Prove that bit strings satisfy the same recurrence as Pascal's triangle.  That is prove that \(|\B^n_k| = |\B^{n-1}_{k-1}| + |\B^{n-1}_k|\).%
\item\label{task-102} \hypertarget{p-567}{}%
Prove that subsets satisfy the same recurrence as Pascal's triangle. Make sure you clearly state what you are proving.%
\item\label{task-103} \hypertarget{p-568}{}%
Prove that lattice paths satisfy the same recurrence as Pascal's triangle.  What exactly do you need to prove here?%
\item\label{task-104} \hypertarget{p-569}{}%
Prove that binomial coefficients (the actual coefficients of the expansion of the binomial \((x+y)^n\)) satisfy the same recurrence as Pascal's triangle.%
