Given a function \(f\) from a \(k\)-element set \(K\) to an \(n\)-element set, we can define a partition of \(K\) by putting \(x\) and \(y\) in the same block of the partition if and only if \(f(x)=f(y)\). How many blocks does the partition have if \(f\) is surjective? How is the number of functions from a \(k\)-element set \emph{onto} an \(n\)-element set related to a Stirling number? Be as precise in your answer as you can.\index{function!surjective!and Stirling Numbers}\index{surjective function!counting}%
