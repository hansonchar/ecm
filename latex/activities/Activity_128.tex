A \terminology{composition} of the integer \(k\) into \(n\) parts is a list of \(n\) positive integers that add to \(k\).  How many compositions are there of an integer \(k\) into \(n\) parts?%

Do you see a relationship between compositions and something else we have counted already?%

\hypertarget{p-892}{}%
There is a bijection between compositions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts and arrangements of \(k\) identical books on \(n\) shelves so that each shelf gets a book. Namely, the number of books on shelf \(i\) is the \(i\)th element of the list. Thus the number of compositions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts is \(\binom{k-1}{n-1}\).%
