Suppose an apple costs 20 cents, a banana costs 25 cents, and a pear costs 30 cents. What should you substitute for \(A\), \(P\), and \(B\) in \hyperref[zerotothreefruits]{Activity~\ref{zerotothreefruits}} in order to get a polynomial in which the coefficient of \(x^n\) is the number of ways to choose a selection of fruit that costs \(n\) cents?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Hint}.\hypertarget{hint-153}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-1273}{}%
For example, to get the cost of the fruit selection \(AP B\) you would want to get \(x^{20} x^{25} x^{30} = x^{75}\).%
